## Key Design Decisions

1. **Sections as First-Class Entity**: Instead of storing section as text, sections are now proper database entities with their own table. This enables:
   - Faculty advisors per section
   - Better timetable management
   - Accurate student grouping
   - Easy section-level queries

2. **Hierarchy Specificity**: Users have `section_id` and `semester` directly on the users table for quick queries without joins.

3. **Parent System**: Parents are users with their own role. Relationships are stored in `parent_student_relations` to support 1-to-many and many-to-many scenarios.

4. **Faculty Allocation**: Faculty can be allocated to multiple sections through subject assignments.

5. **Role-Based Access**: Each role has specific permissions defined in constants and enforced in API routes.

## Migration Notes

When migrating existing data:
1. Create sections for each program-semester combination
2. Assign students to sections based on batch/year
3. Create parent users and set up relationships
4. Allocate existing subjects to sections
5. Update timetable slots with section references

## Future Enhancements

- Academic years table (for multi-year support)
- Attendance table
- Grades/Marks table
- Course prerequisites
- Elective management
- Class transfers
- Assessment templates
- Notification preferences
